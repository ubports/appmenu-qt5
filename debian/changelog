  [ Łukasz 'sil2100' Zemczak ]
  * When working with a Gnome/GTK theme, do the same thing as the gtk2
    platformtheme plugin does - fetch the SystemIconThemeName (and its
    fallback) from settings in the system (LP: #1306472)

appmenu-qt5 (0.3.0+14.04.20140305-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=low

  [ Łukasz 'sil2100' Zemczak ]
  * Initial release.
  * Initial version
  * Fix in a very naiive way the case when a selected, already exported
    menu wants to be re-exported - which causes problems in dbusmenu
  * Enable Gnome and KDE theme look and feel when using appmenu-qt5 -
    it's imperfect, but this approach is the sanest one. For KDE to work
    we need to distropatch Qt5 into making one of the constructors
    public. Also, add basic packaging
  * Enable the possibility of disabling the KDE theme in case we don't
    have the distro-patch in
  * Fix header inclusion, bump debian standard
  * Add copyright headers, add README, fix description and tweak deps
  * Add profile.d files that would export the QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME
    variable to enable appmenu-qt5 by default on the installed system -
    if needed
  * Remove leftover define from debugging
  * Fix the dependencies
  * Tweak the descriptions and README a bit

  [ Ubuntu daily release ]
  * New rebuild forced
